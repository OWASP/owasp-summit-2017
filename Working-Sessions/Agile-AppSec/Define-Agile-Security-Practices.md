## Why

This Working Session will aim to define those Practices in easy-to-use and scalable formats and documentation.

## What

 - What are 'Agile Security Practices'?
 - How can they be measured?
 - Who uses Agile in Security activities? (and are they called 'Agile Security Practices'?)
 - Can a focused and pragmatic list of 'Agile Security Practices' be defined? If so, what is on the list?

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security professionals
- CISOs
- Agile practitioners
- DevSecOps
- SecDevOps
