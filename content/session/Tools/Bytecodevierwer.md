In the evolving world of technology, mobile applications have become omnipresent and this evolution is creating a completely new range of attacks not relevant in the classic web application world.

As AppSec experts, it is our mission to define, promote, and improve mobile application security.

## Why

Bytecodeviewer is possibly the best open source tool for reverse engineering of APK's. This workshop is the result of five months of research into pen testing mobile APK's @Securify.nl

## What

This workshop will provide attendees with knowledge on the following areas:

- The process of pen testing Mobile Android applications vs Web Apps
- The challenges of pen testing Mobile Android apps 
- The role of reverse engineering in pen testing Mobile Apps
- Tools available (Dex2jar, APKTool, Android SDK tools...)
- Rooting your phone
- Installing Xposed Framework
- Why emulators do not provide the right or limited testing environment
- Introduction to Bytecodeviewer
- Reverse Engineering with Bytecodeviewer
- How to use Xposed Framework 
- Smali code and signing APK's
- Analysing with Bytecode and Hacking an app with Xposed
- Using the Xposed Generator (new feature!)
- Pre-release Bytecodeviewer 3.0.0. with new features!

Reverse engineering APKS with Bytecodevierwer (Pre-release 3.0.0) features:

- Xposed class generator from selected decompiled classes
- Signing APKS after de-compilation in Smali
- Improved search functionality

## Outcomes

This Working Session will provide:

- A brief overview of the anatomy of a mobile penetration test
- Information on how to get started with reverse engineering of APK´s.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Anyone new to pen testing mobile android apps
- Anyone new to Bytecodeviewer
