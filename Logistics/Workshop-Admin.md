An Workshop Admin is somebody that is going to work hard during the Summit, helping with workshop related tasks/activities, in exchange for an Summit Ticket and travel expenses.

&nbsp;

This is a win-win situation, where the Summit gains more energy/focus and valuable members of the OWASP community are able to participate on the Summit.

&nbsp;

In order to make the process fair, the following 'rules of engagement' are proposed:

- Help to run at least 6 Working-Sessions
  - Before the Summit
    - Keep track of workshop details (ideally with some minor participation)
    - Create an Workshop Action plan
  - During the Summit
    - Help running the Working-Sessions
    - Help Workshop participants
    - make sure they have all that is needed
    - make sure participants are at the correct workshop
    - Officially recognized as Workshop Admin and single point of contact for those Working-Sessions
    - Print all relevant materials
    - Collect all workshop deliverables
    - Create/facilitate workshop report
    - Help remote participants
- Workshop Admin can be anybody not necessarily technical or involved in the actual project    
- Workshop Admin needs to define time required for each workshop
- Workshop Admin can choose which workshop to support (provided when applying for role)

### Selection priority

  - Number of OWASP past contributions (by order of preference)
    - Owasp conferences
    - Owasp projects
    - Owasp chapter
  - Taking Admin tasks to be responsible
