I am one of the core contributors for OpenSAMM 2.0. I would like to attend OWASP summit so that I can participate in OpenSAMM 2.0 discussions.
The goal is to advance OpenSAMM to include security practices related to DevSecOps agile methology as part of OpenSAMM v2.0. 

I would also like to propose new OWASP project and discuss the same with OWASP leaders.

My skillset would allow me to also contribute to following tracks if I get chance to attend the summit:

- ThreatModel
- DevSecOps
- Education
- GDPR

I would need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as my company won't sponsor the trip - please let us know soon if this would be possible, as I'll need to prepare the material.

* [OWASP OpenSAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) Core Contributor for v2.0

Bio: I led Secure SDL program at one of the big Independent Software Vendors. In that role I contributed to many papers which are read through out the industry on topic of Secure Software Development Lifecycle. OpenSAMM's first leader's work on OpenSAMM is based off of my work at SAFECode. I've contributed to SANS Top 25 programming errors for 3 years in a row which helped improved OWASP Top 10. Currently I'm Secure Software Development Lifecycle leader at a software company which is famous for starting DevSecOps movement. I can help move forward OpenSAMM to include DevSecOps in v2.0. I can also contribute to DevSecOps, Eduction, GDPR and ThreatModeling tracks.
