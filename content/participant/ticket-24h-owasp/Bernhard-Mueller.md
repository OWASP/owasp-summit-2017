I am planning a [mobile application security workshop](/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/index.html) to together with [Sven Schleier](/Participants/funded/Sven-Schleier.html) with the goal of advancing the [Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg). This guide is part of the documents developed in the Mobile Security Testing project. Our vision:

**Define the industry standard for mobile application security.**

## The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

The MSTG is a comprehensive guide for iOS and Android mobile security testers. We aim to build the ultimate learning resource and reference guide for mobile app reversers with the following content:

- Mobile platform internals
- Security testing in the SDLC
- Static and dynamic security testing
- Mobile app reverse engineering and tampering
- Assessing mobile software protections

The MSTG is a work-in-progress. Currently, we hope to be "feature-complete" in Q3 2017. A book version of the current master branch is available on Gitbook.

## What We Need Funding For

Funding goes into flights and accommodation.
