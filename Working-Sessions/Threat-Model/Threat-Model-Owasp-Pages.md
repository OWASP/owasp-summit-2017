description : OWASP Threat Modeling Pages provide global AppSec professionals and companies worldwide with a central reference point to OWASP project, tools, and references that are related to Application Threat Modeling. These pages will provide as a gateway for threat modelers to leverage OWASP threat modeling content as well as other OWASP content and tools that support application threat modeling objectives.

The [OWASP Threat Modeling](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling) pages provide a global representation of application threat modelling content for security professionals worldwide, but the repository is disorganised and some information is incorrect.  This Working Session provides an opportunity to unify OWASP's application threat modelling content that can be vetted by OWASP security professionals worldwide. The pages also provide a way to correlate application security tools, references, and projects with application threat modelling activities.  Tools and references such as cheat sheets, coding guides, and risk models can also correlate to threat modelling activities managed by these pages.  

## Why

This Working Session aims to update the OWASP threat modelling pages. The result will provide application security professionals, architects, and developers with the reliable, authoritative, and prescriptive guidance they need on threat modelling tools, techniques, and methodologies.

## What

- Review and update content on OWASP threat modelling pages
- Create subpages on threat modelling methodologies with details and artefacts
  - Build a complete 'how to' for software-centric threat models
  - Build a complete 'how to' for risk-centric threat models
    - Provide references to risk rating methods that professionals can use
  - Build a complete 'how to' for security centric threat models
  - Provide pointers to OWASP threat modelling cheat sheets, Security Champions, Lightweight threat modelling initiatives 
  
## Outcomes

- Revised content on OWASP threat modelling pages
- Subpages on threat modelling methodologies with details and artefacts created
  
## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Wiki ninjas
 - Experienced threat modeling evangelists
 - Project owners/session organisers for other threat modelling workshops/sessions

### Content

####Synapse/Takeaways
This session was very productive. The group discussed how to improve the OWASP Threat Modelling pages. Specifically, defining the what, why, Who, When and how of Threat Modelling for development and security Roles. The session was split into 3 groups (Software, Risk, security Centric approaches).

#####What/Why
-Define Threat Modelling
-Benefits 

#####Who?
-Developers
-CISO
-Architects
-Penetration Testing 
-New Talent
-Managers

#####When/Typical Scenarios
-SDLC (Development Process) – Agile (Scrum)
-Architectural Reviews (Vendor Risk)
-Pre-Pen Testing (Different Stages)
-Procurement (Quickly)

####How/Approach
-Software Centric
-Risk Centric
-Security Centric 
The Group output is shown below:
