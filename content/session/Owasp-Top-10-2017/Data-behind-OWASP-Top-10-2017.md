Due to its wide use, acceptance, and need for trusted results, it is essential that data supporting the OWASP Top 10 2017 is understood and accepted by the community.

## Why

The OWASP Top 10 2017 made a 'request for data' which might not have reached as wide an audience as it should have reached.

The Summit, and this Working Session, provide a perfect opportunity to allow the current data set to be understood and for new data sets/analysis to be submitted/analysed. The new data will validate the current Top 10 items, or provide evidence for changes.

## What

 - Deep dive into published/original data set
 - Allow new data set and analysis to be submitted (data to be normalised before the Summit)
 - Review data provided and compare with existing Top 10 items
 - (If relevant) create evidence for changes

## Outcomes

 - Majority of participants to agree on the data set supporting the final Top 10 2017 mappings

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- OWASP Top 10 2017 Track participants
- OWASP community
