## Why

Capturing logs and visualising them in a SOC (Security Operation Center) is a key activity in the asymmetric arms race against malicious actors and bugs.

In addition to providing high-value actionable information, a good SOC will provide a wealth of valuable metrics and visualisations for the business, from user activities and behaviour to system performance.

The Working Session will assess the role, the work, and the importance of a SOC within a business.

## What

 - What are the key technical and operational components of SOCs?
 - Map examples of SOC implementations (people, processes and technologies)
 - What are the best practices for capturing logs and feeding them into central locations?
 - What is the business case for a larger SOC which is sponsored by another business unit (i.e. not just Security)?
 - What are the best practices for using tools like ELK or Splunk?
 - How to secure SOCs data and infrastructure
 - How to visualise the data collected in actionable/meaningful graphs
 - How to use Machine Learning and AI to improve data capture and analysis
 - How to use Business Intelligence Techniques and Big Data tools to improve analysis and visualisations
 - Using AppSensor to feed data into SOC and to respond to analysis results
 - Exploring specific security incidents:
    - Malware infection
    - Web Injection attack
    - Account Brute Force attacks
    - Login/activities from non-common locations
    - Business logic exploitation
    - Data extraction
 - How does SOC help with GDPR requirements
 - What to look for - tricks, tips and ideas
