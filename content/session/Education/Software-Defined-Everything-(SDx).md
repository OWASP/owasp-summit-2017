## Why

The much-touted value of SD(x) is the ability to open the API so that the application (client/server or peer to peer) can communicate directly with SDN or SDDC based controllers and provision their own storage, end-to-end service, and so on. Now that the intelligence has been taken out of individual network devices, and the API potentially opened for network-aware application development, the software developer is truly king.  However, this is also true for a would-be attacker. Self-provisioning via an API without proper security is something new to the land of networking. Proper considerations, design, and testing must be integral.

This working session will discuss the hypothesis that while proper controls may be desirable and preordained, given that we already have considerable issues with building security into "conventional" applications, are we not at risk of adding another layer of complexity and another potential version of the OWASP Top 10?

Within the IT industry, SDx or software-defined everything is still a buzz word. Whilst its ultimate position in predictions like the Gartner Hype cycle is a matter of fierce debate, there is an underlying, creeping problem that is not being fully addressed. Software defined networks are still being looked at in terms of infrastructure security and NOT their application security components. The implications of this view are vast and may be crucial to ISP, datacenter, and enterprise security, as the layers of the OSI model continue to merge and transform.

## What

- Exploring the security considerations around SDx, what are the attack surfaces for Software Defined Everything (SDx)?
- Which of the OWASP Top 10 are applicable to SDx applications?
- Exploring potential ways to build more robust application security into the software definition process
- How can SDx be simulated/emulated effectively for SDN/SDDC applications, especially where central controllers and the API are concerned? 
- Preparing the future direction in terms of an all-inclusive approach to SDx security, including a holistic view of both application and infrastructure aspects
