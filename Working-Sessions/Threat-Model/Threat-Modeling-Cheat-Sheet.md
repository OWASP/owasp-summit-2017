description : OWASP cheat sheet will provide prescriptive guidance on threat modeling activities, tasks, and output deliverables that should be produced as part of one of three varying methodologies (software centric, security centric, risk centric approaches) and tailored to application environments that are domain agnostic.

 - Splitting up threat models integration into domain-agnostic and domain-specific
 - Enabling Security champions to perform domain agnostic threat models

> [OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet)
> The objective of this cheat sheet is to provide guidance to developers, reviewers, designers and architects on conducting successful
> threat modeling. The main goal of threat modeling is to understand the controls needed for a software system. This is a complex
> endeavor that will involve investigations into:

    The trust boundaries to and within the solution that we build
    The actors that interact within and outside of the trust boundaries
    Information flows within and to and from the trust boundaries
    Information persistence within and out of trust boundaries
    Vulnerabilities at trust boundaries
    Threat agents that can exploit the vulnerabilities
    Impact of exploitation of vulnerability by a threat agents
    Controls and process needed to treat specific risks

### Context

Threat modeling still needs great adoption into current SDLC methodologies. Many development groups strive to apply threat modeling efforts under tight development windows.  The threat cheat sheet modeling cheat sheet aims to provide prescriptive guidance on scoping, application component enumeration, threat modeling activities, and key deliverables.

### Potential outcome

 * DFD Template
 * Kill chain template
 * Attack tree template
 * Component enumeration techniques
 * Attack library build out and mapping
 * Proposed threat library and integration
 * Weakness library management and integration


### Participant candidates

 * Application Architects (for DFD creation, templating)
 * Web developers of varying language backgrounds (.NET, Java, PHP, *.js, etc.)
 * DBAs/ DB Developers
 * Security professionals w/ application architecture, software development experience
