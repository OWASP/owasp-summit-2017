### Synopsis & Takeaways
 
The last afternoon session on June 13th for Cheat Sheets decided that we need to deliver a number of FAQs and functional requirements to ensure better participation and clarity around the process.

**The proposed topics are:**

  - How to create a new cheat sheet?
  - How to modify?
  - How to get consensus for publication?
  - How to move from draft to final?
  - What is a valid cheat sheet topic?
  - When to retire or remove one (currency test)?

**Functional requirements:**

  - Last edit date on the Wiki
  - Last review date on the Wiki
  - Status label
  - Clear status label on template
  - Standardisation of tagging for SEO ranking and searching.
