> _Learning by doing_ is a quite successful education concept. Although
> software developers are typically not meant to become professional
> pentesters, it is still a valuable approach to teach them the
> _Attackers Perspective_ and let them loose on practical hacking
> exercises or vulnerable applications. Only when they ~~saw something
> break~~**break something themselves**, can they appreciate all the
> secure coding guidelines _as help_ and not see them as _an
> impediment_.


## Why

In this working session, we will share our experience with various tools
and services used in practical developer security training sessions.

## What

- How to sell the idea of "breaking" things to developers who typically
  have constructive mindsets
- How to integrate exercises into instructor-led training sessions
- Do you advocate do-it-yourself learning?
- Share experiences using current online service providers
- Run-through of open source tools (like WebGoat, Security Shepherd,
  Juice Shop)
- Are vendor demo applications (like AltoroMutual) an option?
- What (if any) tools for pentesting (like ZAP or Burp) do you
  recommend or use in dev trainings?

## Outcomes

- Recommendation for a
  [eLearning Path](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Working-Sessions/Education/Teaching-Attacker-Perspective-to-Developers/eLearningPath.md)
  guiding developers through various hands-on sessions in an appropriate
  order (e.g. with increasing difficulty)
- [Best Practices](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Working-Sessions/Education/Teaching-Attacker-Perspective-to-Developers/BestPractices.md)
  for developer-focused security training
