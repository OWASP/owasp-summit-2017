## Why

Handling external submissions of security vulnerabilities either directly or via bug bounty programmes is not a trivial task and should not be left to chance.

It is critical to follow very specific workflows that address the original issue, and that discover and fix (if necessary) any possible variations.

It is also very important to have very focused and technically correct exchanges with the external individual(s) who submitted the security vulnerability.

This Working Session will create a bug bounty playbook.
