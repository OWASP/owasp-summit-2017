## Why

OWASP Cheat Sheets are a concise collection of high-value information on various security topics. Created by application security professionals with hands-on experience, OWASP Cheat Sheets provide security guidance in an easy-to-read format.

The purpose of this Working Session is to revise and improve the existing OWASP Cheat Sheets.

## What

- Bring together Cheat Sheets creators and users

  - Working Sessions on improving existing Cheat Sheets, debating finer details of their content, and creating new ones
  - Work on an updated version of the Cheat sheets book https://www.owasp.org/images/9/9a/OWASP_Cheatsheets_Book.pdf (maybe adding it to Leanpub and Amazon)
- Plan next steps and what should be worked on next (after the Summit)
- Question: What would be a realistic deliverable for the Summit?

## Outcomes

This Working Session will draft and publish a set of revised OWASP Cheat Sheets. 

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security professionals
