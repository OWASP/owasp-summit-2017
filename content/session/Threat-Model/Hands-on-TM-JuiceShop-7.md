Get together to use the models of Juice Shop to find problems with it, learn threat modelling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artifacts & examples for the Juice Shop vulnerable app.

## What

- Using the list of issues with Juice Shop, "propose" various ways to fix it.  Obviously, this is at odds with the real goal of Juice Shop, which is to be vulnerable, but ways to fix it will act as useful models, and complete the threat model.

## Outcomes

- Documented suggested fixes

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Participants in the threat modeling track
- Participants interested in Juice Shop
- Those who want to learn to threat model.
