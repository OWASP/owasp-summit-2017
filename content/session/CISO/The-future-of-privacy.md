Is there a future for privacy?

## Why

The target of this session is to illuminate the security of personal data from a strategic point of view:
risks, controls and measures, and future trends.
At the end of this session there should be a set of expert statements concerning current and future
challenges for improving the security of personal data.
We can use the statements to launch a public OWASP campaign on privacy.
A session concerning privacy was held during the OWASP Summit 2011 (see (1)) - the results of
that workshop may serve as a basis for the 2017 session.

It is possible to argue that privacy is not a priority in the work of OWASP, but I disagree.
- Privacy is a very important topic for everyone. As it relates to information security, it should be a priority for OWASP.
- Improving privacy in the future will primarily be a software challenge, especially for web applications and IoT. That is OWASP.
- OWASP is well known by experts, but not by the public. I think OWASP should have more weight in public discussion, and a privacy campaign is a good way to raise OWASP's public profile.

## What

- Personal data risk assessment: Definition and categorization of assets, criticality, vulnerabilities, threat vectors, risks.
  What work is already done, what remains to be worked out?
- Privacy-"triage": what kinds of data are already "lost", what can still be saved?
- Which technical solutions will we need in the future - not what is technically possible but what is needed
  from the viewpoint of individuals?
- What are the upcoming challenges of web application security for improving privacy/protection of personal data?
- Who are the stakeholders of these technical developments?
- Which driving forces can be used to kick-off development processes?

## Outcomes

- OWASP Privacy statements
- Concept of a campaign and compliance of OWASP community and foundation, road map

### Synopsis and Takeaways

"Is there a future for privacy?"

Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1791: "There is no freedom without security"

--- A. GENERAL ---

A.1 It's not a legal question! Privacy as matter for individuals, not courts!

A.2 It's not question of compliance (of companies, organizations, etc)!

A.3 It's not a question of identifiability: we assume here that you ARE identifiable!

A.4 Review resources: are there resources for privacy which

	- list types of privacy items

	- deliver categorys of privacy

--- B. RISKS ----

B.1 Types of privacy / personal data (brain storming)

   including criticality (high | medium |low | none)

	- Name
	- Gender
	- Address
	- Email address
	- Phone numbers
	- Photos/Videos of person
	- Date of birth
	- Place of birth
	- Name of schools / universities / employers
	- Job-position
	- Salary
	- Property
	- Passport data
	- Biometric data, e.g. Thumbprint
	- Social security number / health insurance ID
	- IP-Address
	- Cookies
	- Credit-Card numbers
	- Bank account numbers
	- Health data
	- DNA-profile
	- Live style data / tracking
        - Location data / movement profiles
	- Consumer data
	- Digital signatures
	- Digitally stored manual signatures (e.g. signature pads)
	- Criminal records
	- Political, religious or philosophical beliefs

B.2 Categories of privacy / personal data (brain storming)

	Main categories:
	- Personal identifiable information (PII)
	- Sensitive personal information (SPI) [context dependend]

Sub categories:
	- Legally relevant data
	- Insurance relevant data
	- Socially relevant data
	- Financial data

--- C. CONTROLS & MEASURES (WEB-APPS) ---

C.1 Browser technology: what should be improved (not: what is technical possible and not what vendors like to do)

C.2 Rules for apps: privacy by design

C.3 Automated information to individuals, not on request (e.g. once a year etc)

--- D. FUTURE TRENDS ---

D.1 Are there technical solutions conceivable, which help individuals to collect

   - Who has which type of personal data stored
   - Where is it stored?

   This concerns "white hats", that is, companies, organizations, and governments who have stored data.

   The "black hats" (criminal individuals or gangs) are not in focus here.


## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Everyone who cares about privacy.
