title    : Incident Response Playbook

## Outcomes

- Incident response playbook

### Synopsis and Takeaways

#### Goals
- IR from a developer’s perspective
- Don’t cover entire IR field, just the developer’s roles and responsibilities
- Reinforce how other best practices, such as threat models, support the IR process

#### Preparation
- Conduct fire drill – consider tabletop exercises
- Assign points of contact (e.g., Security Champions)
- Rapid deployment plan
- Logging

#### Questions that will be asked
- Is it our data?
- Is it a breach?
- What app/service provides the data?
- Where did the data come from?
- Can the data be time stamped?
- What does it mean?
- Does it have value?
- Can we roll back to last known ‘good’ state?

#### Response to incident
- Rapid deployment, owners have to know their roles
- Communication – keep people updated with minimal publicity
- Log what happens, and when, so people coming in as the crisis develops can be brought up to speed quickly
- Stagger engineering team so that 24/7 coverage is possible (people need to rest, eat, etc.)
- The benefit of a situation dealt with quickly and efficiently outweighs the cost of the remedy and the cost to the business

#### Post Mortem
- Did the threat model cover this?
- Bug Bounty the target?
- Why did it happen?
- How did we react?
- Was best practice followed?
  - If not, why not?
- Tuning web application firewalls

#### Lessons learnt / next steps
- How many pre-requisites were satisfied?
- Was Playbook appropriate?
- Variables will cause gaps in PB
- What adjustments need to be made?

#### Overall outcome
- We feel that a Preparation Guide could satisfy needs in this area, perhaps building on Tom Brennan’s OWASP Incident Response Project
