## Why

Use of vulnerable components (A9) contributes to some of the worlds largest breaches. It's unique among other types of security issues in that vulnerabilities can suddently arrise at any point in the software development lifecycle with or without code changes. OWASP Depencency-Check, a project created by Jeremy Long in 2012, is a flagship OWASP project with thousdands of users and many volunteers. It has grown from a single command line tool into a full suite designed to provide visibility of vulnerable components throughout the software development lifecycle. 

## What

* An overview of the state-of-the-art of the Dependency-Check & Dependency-Track ecosystem
* Provide sneak peak at v2.0.0
* Demos (may the demo gods be gracious)
* Get direct feedback on existing and in-progress features

## Outcomes

* Identify areas Dependency-Check and Dependency-Track need improvement
* Learn about complimentary issues that put use of third-party components at risk
* Learn how to contribute to the projects

## Who

* Security practitioners
* CI/CD/DevOps practitioners
* Software engineers
* QA engineers
* Anyone responsible for the design, creation, testing, or operation of software
