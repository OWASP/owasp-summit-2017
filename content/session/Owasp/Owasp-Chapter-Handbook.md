The joint purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook and the OWASP Chapter Leader Handbook is to provide chapter leaders with a central repository of information about starting a chapter, organising a chapter meeting, handling chapter finances, etc.   
The Handbook is currently under review, and the updated version is currently in draft form. 
This Working Session will discuss and agree on any open issues. The session will also consider new issues, particularly those relating to atypical chapters and the different styles of chapter operation.
