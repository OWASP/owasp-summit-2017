## Why

Playbooks contain specific workflows which must be executed in a particular sequence.

Jira is a tool widely used by developers and security teams, which means that if Jira Workflows of Security Playbooks exist, we will have a scalable and easy-to-deploy solution for using the playbooks.

Jira Workflows also have the advantage of providing Kanban boards and dashboards which are important for management reporting.

This Working Session will discuss and create JIRA workflows for security playbooks.
