# Remote Participants

The thinking behind the remote participation is to support them directly via Google Hangouts (using TVs to share the images and 4G mobile data for connectivity)

For the participants that register their interest (on this page and on the respective working session) we will have somebody dedicated to ‘connect them’ to the respective working session

If you can participate remotely, please copy this [remote participant template](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/blob/master/Participants/_template/remote-participant.md) and add it to [this folder](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Participants/remote)

#### Free Participation
At the moment there is no cost for participating remotely, but if you can [buy a ticket](/website/buy-ticket.html) it will make a big difference and help a lot (since we are using all available funds to bring more attendees to the Summit)
