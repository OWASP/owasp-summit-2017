> _Learning by doing_ is a quite successful education concept. Although
> software developers are typically not meant to become professional
> pentesters, it is still a valuable approach to teach them the
> _Attackers Perspective_ and let them loose on practical hacking exercises
> or vulnerable applications. Only when they ~~saw something
> break~~**break something themselves**, can they appreciate all the
> secure coding guidelines _as help_ and not see them as _an impediment_.


## Why

In this working session, we can share our experience with various tools
and services used in practical developer security training sessions.

- How to sell the idea of "breaking" things to developers who typically have constructive mindsets
- How to integrate exercises into instructor-led training sessions
- Do you advocate do-it-yourself learning?
- Share experiences using current online service providers
- Run-through of open source tools (like WebGoat, Security Shepherd, Juice Shop)
- Are vendor demo applications (like AltoroMutual) an option?

## Potential Outcome

- Recommendation for a _Learning Path_ guiding developers through
  various hands-on sessions in an appropriate order (e.g. with
  increasing difficulty)
- _Best Practice_ for developer-focused security training
- Developer training _Antipatterns_ and _Pitfalls_
