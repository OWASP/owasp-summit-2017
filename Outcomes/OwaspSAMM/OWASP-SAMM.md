# Core Metrics
## Outcomes

This Working Session will result in updated SAMM Metrics and an outline plan for the future updates.

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- There is a need to evaluate adding an optional depth component to scoring for questionnaire
- Need to most likely remove success metrics and replace with Business Metrics
  - Alternatively Metrics may have its own section
  - We need to focus on metrics ranging from operational to strategic operations
- Three logical categories of metrics
  - App
  - Process
  - Environment

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is

- Security champions
- Security architects
- DevOps Roles
- CISO

# Core Model Update - Dev Methods
## Outcomes
### Synopsis and Takeaways
- Restructure SAMM activities with an increasing maturity of implementation
- Apply this restructure to all SAMM practises and activities (high level).
- Create one or more detailed descriptions with implementation guidance

# Core Model Update - Implementation
## Outcomes

- Core Model

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- We are exploring adding a fifth business function to the SAMM Model.
- This function will be somewhere between the current "Construction" and "Verification" business functions
- The new function may encompass code building and code mangement
- The current "Construction" Business Function is mostly about design, so needs recategorising
- Defect management is not clearly defined in the current SAMM Model
- We will probably need to make fundamental additions and changes to the current SAMM Model
- Ideas for the new business function naming and criteria have been put forward
- Ideas for new security practices have been noted
- Likely updates to the "Operations" business function are to be made to account for more infrastructure-related activities

# DataSet Project
## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- The Dataset Project was unanimously agreed upon to be a key project for OWASP and is worth pursuing.
- The Dataset project is key to the SAMM project as a whole
- For the project to progress steadily it is important to collect names that are willing to contribute to the project consistently
- Create a survey that is to be sent via the "SAMM users mailing list", in order to gain valuable information about what users want from the Dataset

# Introduction - GDOSMM
## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways
- No need to change the core model but reviewing the SAMM activities is important to assure they are implementation neutral
- In addition Implementation advice can be included for different roles and processes e.g. DevOps, Waterfall and Agile
- GDOSMM is a potential implementation subset of SAMM
- An evening session was agreed for model mapping SAMM to GDOSMM
- The effort/impact dimensions suggested make for an interesting addition to activities

# Kick-off
## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- Captured expectations of participants
- Better understanding
- Include agile/devops
- Contribute
- Tools
- Benchmarking

- Make the model more “agile”?
- Focus on developers.
- Measure efficiency
- SAMM Profiles


## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security champions

### Content

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
- Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices
- Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations
- Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program
- Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization

# Outreach and Market
## Outcomes

- High-level plan for promoting and integrating SAMM

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- Need a marketing specialist to construct a model for SAMM to improve market awareness
- Invite members of the mailing list to create a video showcasing some real world evidence of SAMM in action
- Need a way to measure downloads of the SAMM model; a possible solution is to link to the model from GitHub

# OWASP Project alignment
## Outcomes

- Recommendations for addition to SAMM
- Plan for project and activity alignment

### Synopsis and Takeaways

- We must make sure to remap “Flagship” and “Lab” projects for SAMM Version 2
- Reach out to “Flagship” and “Lab” leaders to get references to the SAMM project and, if possible, link to an activity or     security process.
- Identify the missing tools and artefacts needed for different activates
- Make sure to promote the missing tools and artefacts to encourage people to undertake the project themselves
- Map a lower level of granularity; map at a level of activities  

# Stories and Templates
## Outcomes
- New templates drafted
- Existing use cases updated
- New use cases identified

# SAMM V2 Ground Rules
### Synopsis and Takeaways

- One Model
- Evolution
- Scope equals software
- Experiment with tagging to cover various viewpoints
- Extra working session to discuss DevSecOps maturity model (tomorrow – morning session)
- Keep it simple with a Balanced model (desirable)
