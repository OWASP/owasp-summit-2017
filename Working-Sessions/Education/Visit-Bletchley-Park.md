## IF YOU ARE NAMED AS A PARTICIPANT, YOU WILL NEED TO BRING A CASH PAYMENT OF £12.50 TO COVER YOUR NATIONAL MUSEUM OF COMPUTING TOUR. THE ENTRANCE FEE FOR BLETCHLEY PARK IS £17.75. (A TOTAL OF £30.25 IS REQUIRED FOR BOTH SITES) PLEASE TRY TO BRING THE RIGHT MONEY TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS OR THE TOUR MAY BE DELAYED.

This session takes a step back from current pressing cyber-security concerns and travels back in time to the place where, in a sense, it all began, nearby [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/).

Enemy messages were decrypted at Bletchley Park during WW II. This capability was a closely guarded secret and turned out to be of decisive importance to the outcome of the war.

This is the place where Alan Turing designed the Bombe in 1939 to decrypt messages produced by German Enigma machines. The Colossus series, arguably the world's first programmable electronic digital computers, were designed and built here between 1943 and 1945 to break the Lorenz cipher.

## Why

This historic place is now a museum, or, perhaps more accurately, a cluster of temporary and permanent exhibitions, including

* [Museum in Block B](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/visit-us/what-to-see/museum-in-block-b) containing original Enigma machines, a fully operational Bombe rebuild and a gallery dedicated to the life and work of Alan Turing.
* [The National Museum of Computing](http://www.tnmoc.org/) is also on the Bletchley Park campus, featuring a rebuild of Colossus.
* [An exhibition celebrating the centenary of Bill Tutte](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/whats-on/bill-tutte-mathematician-codebreaker), a key figure in breaking the Lorenz cipher and building Colossus.

## What

A guided tour at the National Museum of Computing has been booked between 1:30 and 3 PM. The guide is flexible and expects us to tell him our specific interests at the start of the tour.

We will spend the rest of the afternoon on the Bletchley campus. The site closes at 5 PM.
Exhibits listed above are a suggestion, but feel free to pursue your own interests.

### Transport Arrangements:

A bus has been arranged to take us from the conference center to Bletchley. Please meet at the reception of 'The Venue' at 1pm and you will be taken to the pick up point. This will be a staggered departure process, please be patient while you are allocated a bus seat.

### Tickets

Do *not* require ticket (e.g. season Pass owners)
* Bjoern Kimminich (ticket for Bletchley Park)
* Bolot Kerimbaev (ticket for Bletchley Park)

## Who

Anyone interested in the history of our field.
