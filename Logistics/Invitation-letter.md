If you need an invitation letter from OWASP to help making the case to come to the Summit, here is an example of one we have used before.

This can be sent by one of the Summit organizers or from one of the OWASP Employees (in paper or email).

Dear {name}

On behalf of the Organizers of the OWASP Summit 2017, I am pleased to invite you to participate in our event, which will be held in London, England, from 12 to 16 June 2017.

The OWASP summit 2017 is not a traditional conference with uni-directional presentations, it is a working environment with working sessions on areas like: 
- DevOps,
- Threat Modeling, 
- Mobile Security,
- DDoS, 
- Cyber Warfare 
- and other working sessions on popular OWASP projects (lead by its leaders).

Using the same model as the previous OWASP Summits, this 5 day event will be a high energy experience, where the attendees are expected to work and collaborate really hard. Every working session will be thoroughly prepared and focused on actionable outcomes.

We are certain that your presence will contribute to the success of our Summit and will also allow you to acquire knowledge and have direct interactions with OWASP’s community and projects. We are sure this multiple-way exchange of ideas will be extremely beneficial to all the people involved. We assure you that our event is one-of-a-kind and that the participants are highly-knowledgeable professionals such as yourself.

The cost for participants will be EUR 1400 + VAT and covers your stay, accommodations, meals and the event fees. In order to allow for better planning we would ask you to confirm your willingness to participate as soon as possible.

Best regards,
