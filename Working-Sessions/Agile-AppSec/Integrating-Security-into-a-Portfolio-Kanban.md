## Why

Integration of information security into the Portfolio Kanban enables organisations to have a fully secure workstreams through every single stage of the project development cycle. In the agile world the integration of security has to start at the earlier possible stage and that is, in most of the cases the portfolio management workstream definition stage which usually utilises Kanban. This session will be used to discuss the challenges and advantages of that approach and how one can plan and execute this model across environments.
