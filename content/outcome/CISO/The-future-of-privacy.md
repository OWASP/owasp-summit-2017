title    : The Future of Privacy
---

### Outcomes / Statements
1. Data minimazation is a best practice, but
      > its difficult to control
      > it's difficult to enforce, because there is no general exact
        definition, what "minimization" means
      > it can be  bypassed using a broad formulated user consent
      > we may loose this fight ...

2. Instead of enforce data minimazation we could invent a
    misuse-based model:
      > collecting and selling personal data is a successful business
        model - therefore data minimazation is hard to enforce
      > so: collecting data is NOT a misuse
      > using data without a specific user-consent IS a misuse
      > Correlation and / or merging of different data sources IS
        a misuse
      > future challenge:  misuse cases of specific data may change
        in future

3. data anonymization is a best practice, but
      > big data analysis of combined data-sets may enable a
        re-personalization of previously anonymized data
      > in case of a secure, effective (randomized) data anonymization
        there should be no restrictions for data collection

4. Enforcing a consent-by-usage / consent-by-purpose model may be a part
   of a solution
      > so: organizations are allowed to store the data, but they
        HAVE TO aks for a usage consent for any type of content at any
        time they want to use those data for a new purpose
      > this consent has to have an defined expiration date

5. All data have to contain an individual time-of-expiration, were they
  have to be deleted automatically (auto-destroy mechanism)
  (except regulatory requirements force a later date of deletion)

6. How can we achieve that respecting privacy issues is seen as a business
  advantage and not a penalty? Which respect-privacy-incentives
  are possible?

7. People are adviced to use fake-identities where ever possible!

### Synopsis and Takeaways

"Is there a future for privacy?"

Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1791: "There is no freedom without security"

#### General

A.1 It's not a legal question! Privacy as matter for individuals, not courts.

A.2 It's not question of compliance (of companies, organizations, etc.)

A.3 It's not a question of identifiability: we assume here that you ARE identifiable!

A.4 Review resources: are there resources for privacy which

	- List types of privacy items

	- Deliver categorys of privacy

#### Risks

B.1 Types of privacy / personal data (brain storming)

   Including criticality (high | medium |low | none)

	- Name
	- Gender
	- Address
	- Email address
	- Phone numbers
	- Photos/Videos of person
	- Date of birth
	- Place of birth
	- Name of schools / universities / employers
	- Job-position
	- Salary
	- Property
	- Passport data
	- Biometric data, e.g., thumbprint
	- Social security number / health insurance ID
	- IP-Address
	- Cookies
	- Credit card numbers
	- Bank account numbers
	- Health data
	- DNA-profile
	- Live style data / tracking
        - Location data / movement profiles
	- Consumer data
	- Digital signatures
	- Digitally stored manual signatures (e.g., signature pads)
	- Criminal records
	- Political, religious or philosophical beliefs

B.2 Categories of privacy / personal data (brain storming)

	Main categories:
	- Personal identifiable information (PII)
	- Sensitive personal information (SPI) [context dependend]

Sub categories:
	- Legally relevant data
	- Insurance relevant data
	- Socially relevant data
	- Financial data

#### Controls and Measures (Web Apps) 

C.1 Browser technology: what should be improved (not: what is technical possible and not what vendors like to do)

C.2 Rules for apps: privacy by design

C.3 Automated information to individuals, not on request (e.g. once a year etc)

#### Trends

D.1 Are there technical solutions conceivable, which help individuals to collect

   - Who has which type of personal data stored?
   - Where is it stored?

   This concerns "white hats", that is, companies, organizations, and governments who have stored data.

   The "black hats" (criminal individuals or gangs) are not in focus here.
