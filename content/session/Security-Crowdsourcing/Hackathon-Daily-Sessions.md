## Why

Having the woodstock of Appsec in London, it´s a must to put some people working on bug hunting tasks and improve the world. But we need also to help new ones into the bug hunting world. We need to map OWASP effort into bug hunting opportunities.

## What

Recap on Bug Hunting Programs requirements and benefits.

Bug Bounty Group Hack (e.g. similar to [Great OWASP Bug Bash of 2013](http://2013.appsecusa.org/2013/activities/bug-bounty-group-hack/index.html) at AppSecUSA complying with the [Team OWASP - Bug Bounty Program Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rRZ--hH417l1RiIzsXY8PAOjnjEo4fBRZSL-t4U-uJA/edit))
