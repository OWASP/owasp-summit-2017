### Hilton Syon Park

Hotel inside London. It is in a park so not really in central London (i.e. it has a good level of 'remoteness'). They don't have villas or cabins, but there are plenty of spaces that we can convert into  'Summits Social events'.

The conference size will scale up to 600 participants, but we will only be able to fit about 150 people in the hotel (there are other hotels a short uber ride distance)

Projected cost per person: £259
