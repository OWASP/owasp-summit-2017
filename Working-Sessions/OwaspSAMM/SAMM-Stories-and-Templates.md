Update the SAMM use cases.

## Why

It is time to update the use cases provided with SAMM. Development methodologies and business models have changed in the last 10 years and we need to catch up. We also need to explore the addition of new templates that will provide a starting point for prescriptive guidance in which activities to prioritise, and which maturity targets to aim for, depending on the demographics and corporate culture of an organisation.
