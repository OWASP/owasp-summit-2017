# Recruiting AppSec Talent
---

I am looking forward to contributing to the Threat Modeling workshops, as I have a lot of varied experience in this area, including constrained environments, paranoid cultures (ala defense and military), limited engagements, and full-scope in-depth ongoing security teams. This is also my current area of research. 

I am also interested in the SAST sessions, as well as OWASPSAMM.
