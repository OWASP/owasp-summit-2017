## What

* Collaborative programming sessions on OWASP code/tool projects
* Collaborative writing/editing session on OWASP documentation projects
* Bug Bounty Group Hack (e.g. similar to [Great OWASP Bug Bash of 2013](http://2013.appsecusa.org/2013/activities/bug-bounty-group-hack/index.html) at AppSecUSA complying with the [Team OWASP - Bug Bounty Program Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rRZ--hH417l1RiIzsXY8PAOjnjEo4fBRZSL-t4U-uJA/edit))
