Cofounder of the OWASP Foundation, long time OWASP Contributor, currently leading the Top 10 and Benchmark projects:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10 - Go here to download the 2017 Top 10 Release Candidate. Join the Top 10 mailing list and provide feedback. Meet me at the summit, attend a Top 10 session to help us make it better.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Benchmark - If you aren't familiar with project, attend the working session to learn more. If you want to help, even better!! Let's discuss how to improve this project so it has even more impact than it already has.
