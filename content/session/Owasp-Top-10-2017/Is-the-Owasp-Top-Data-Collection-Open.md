## Why

OWASP Top 10 is one of the most important and widely recognised OWASP projects. OWASP's reputation and value to the AppSec
community depends greatly on the 'O' part of OWASP (Open).

The current RC version of the OWASP Top 10 2017 has generated some debate about the openness of the process used, and the potential conflicts of interest for the authors. However, the authors have claimed that this was the most Open process so far.

This Working Session presents an opportunity to clarify this situation, and for evidence to be presented and discussed on both
sides of the argument.

See [Behind the The OWASP Top 10 2017 RC1](https://medium.com/@JoshCGrossman/behind-the-the-owasp-top-10-2017-rc1-df43236f79ff) for good points on the need to be independent and open.
