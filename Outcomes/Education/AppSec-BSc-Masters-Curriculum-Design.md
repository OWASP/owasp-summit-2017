## Outcomes

This Working Session will deliver the following documents:

- a core set of learning objectives for BSC/MSc level Application Security curricula
- a strategy for the OWASP community to support AppSec curricula

### Synopsis and Takeaways

This session supported the need for a generic curriculum for application security in university BSC/MSC programs. This involved particular patterns of delivery and how deep/complex the curriculum needed to be.
The session looked for a first step strategy, for further discussion at subsequent meetings. The major takeaway was an agreement that there is not enough APPSEC in educational curriculums. The solution is to 
have a low-level set of core learning objectives, that can be incorporated by secondary educational institutions. A modular set of advanced learning objectives to be built for higher educational settings, based around Builder, Breaker, and Defender frameworks.
