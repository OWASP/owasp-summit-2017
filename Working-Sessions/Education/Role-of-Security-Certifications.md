Security certifications may or may not be helpful in furthering a security career, but many security professionals feel they must "comply" with the unspoken expectation that certifications are essential for career advancement. 

## Why

In addition to security certifications, there are several other courses and credentials that focus on specific technology areas. The key challenge for any IT security enthusiast at any point in his or her career is to identify the skills levels required (from beginner to expert), and then look for reputable certifications that will result in career advancement. Fortunately, there are many opportunities available.

As the market for information security talent grows, and the skills shortage continues, InfoSec professionals who have the right combination of credentials and experience are in remarkably high demand. While certifications do not guarantee a job offer, prospective employers look for industry-leading credentials as one measure of qualifications and commitment to quality.
