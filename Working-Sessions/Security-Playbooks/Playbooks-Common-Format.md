## Why

To collaborate effectively and agree on a common format for the playbooks, we should clearly define what we want the playbooks to look like, what format to submit the data in, and what the result will be.

Isn't it better to consolidate the actions of the SecOps Team, AppSec Team, and SOC into Playbooks (i.e. workflows on how to act/behave)?

The Cisco security blog describes a Playbook in the following way: 

> "... To be clear, the Playbook is for organizing and documenting security monitoring. It isn’t an incident response handbook or a policy document or any other type of security document or handbook. The Playbook may reference things like the Incident Response Handbook or Acceptable Use Policy, but it isn’t a replacement for these...."

(see [Using a “Playbook” Model to Organize Your Information Security Monitoring Strategy](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/using-a-playbook-model-to-organize-your-information-security-monitoring-strategy) )

This should be based on git/GitHub, and should consider the numerous tools that are currently in use.

It is also important to assess the code/scripts that support the automation of these Playbooks.

The Working Session will explore these issues to prepare for the various Playbook Working Sessions with the aim of agreeing on a definition and common format of a Playbook.
