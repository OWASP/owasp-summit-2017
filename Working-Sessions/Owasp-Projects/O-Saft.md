[OWASP - SSL advanced forensic tool](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/O-Saft) is an easy to use tool to check various SSL/TLS related configurations, behaviours and vulnerabilities.
It's a standalone tool and can be used in closed and very restricted environments.


## Why

Currently the tool is developed and maintained by a very small team. There is just enough time to keep the check up-to-date, accommodating new vulnerabilities, behaviours, etc.

The Working Session will focus on the internal redesign and some improvements the tool needs to bring full power to its users.

## What

- Improve checking of certificates
- Implement state-of-the-art checking of OCSP
- Improve checking of DH parameters and EC parameters
- Write post processors for formatting the output; a lot of code is already there, it needs to be extracted in new tools
- Implement fuzzing features using TLS-attacker
- Build a test suite, run automated tests
- Build a sophisticated knowledge database with search capabilities (probably using Python NLTK)
- Is there a need for a GTK-based GUI (i.e. using YAD)?

## Outcomes

- Updated and more efficient O-Saft
- Improved tools
- New knowledge base
