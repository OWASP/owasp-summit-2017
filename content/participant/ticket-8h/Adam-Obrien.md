I'm the editor of Oracle's secure software development lifecycle called Oracle Software Security Assurance standards. My focus is making sure that our security assurance process is effective and efficient for all development models. I've recently worked on an overhaul of the process to better fit with cloud, devops, and agile development.

I'll be attending most of the Open SAMM sessions.
I'd like to attend the session on 'A7 - Insufficient Attack Protection' but this clashes with the Open SAMM sessions.
