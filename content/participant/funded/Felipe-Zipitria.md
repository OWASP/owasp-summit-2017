## Felipe Zipitria

Felipe is a Msc. in Computer Security from University of the Republic (Uruguay). He has been working as a System Administrator for 20 years, and as a Security Consultant for 10+ years. He has been teaching Computer Security Fundamentals to pregraduate students and Web Application Security for postgraduates at the local public University.

He will be attending the many workshops Education and DevSecOps tracks.

I will need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as my University isn't sponsoring the trip.
