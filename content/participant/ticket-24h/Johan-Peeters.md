My background is development. I moved into architecture when I realized the importance of getting the non-functional requirements right. From there, it was a small step to, what was at the time, the most neglected of these, namely security.

I have been an independent for over 15 years and served many companies, both large and small, in a variety of industries. Until recently, I mainly worked on a best-effort, time-and-material basis. Lately, I have been working on fixed-price, result-based contracts, and loving it.
