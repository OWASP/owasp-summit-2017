Summit Participants, the success of the Summit depends on the amount of talent that we are able bring together.

Although the current [list of Participants](http://owaspsummit.org/website/participants.html) is already quite impressive, I'm sure we can do better, and bring even more talent to the Summit.

Since you will also be a beneficiary from talent, I would like to ask you (Summit Participant), to reach to your business and social networks, and share with them your views on the Summit (namely why you are going)

Here are good resources you can use:

 - [Owasp Summit 2017](https://owasp.blogspot.co.uk) - From Owasp Blog
 - [Owasp Summit 2017 - 24 days to go](https://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/owasp-summit-2017-24-days-to-go) - Slide deck I presented recently at Owap London's Chapter meeting
 - [@OwaspSummit](https://twitter.com/owaspsummit) twitter feed

So please tweet, blog, email or present the Owasp Summit, and help to keep the energy up.
