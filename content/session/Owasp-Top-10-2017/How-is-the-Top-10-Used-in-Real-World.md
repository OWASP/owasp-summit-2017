According to Verizon's 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report, web application attacks are one of the leading causes of data breaches. Still, many organizations find it hard to protect themselves simply because they don't know where to start.

Can OWASP Top 10 become their starting point?

## Why

The OWASP Top 10 is a well-known index of web app security vulnerabilities which is used every day by security professionals. But one thing is missing from the index—how is OWASP Top 10 list used in real life?

 - Map cases where Top 10 was abused (in its use or in product's marketing)
 - Normalise data and find patterns
 - Provide recommendations for new Top 10 (aligned to how it is used)
