Working session to crowd source best practices for deployment and managing Web Application Firewalls.

## Why
Web Application Firewalls require the skills and knowledge of Network, Security, and Application subject matter experts.
These teams need to collaborate on WAF configurations in order to ensure that business, operational, and security requirements are all met with minimal impact to the business and its customers. In practice this is hard to achieve; the team managing WAF should be involved in application projects from day one but are often forgotten till the end of a project.

## What
- Planning
  - Requirements & Expectations 
  - Team Dynamics & Route to Live 
- Architecture & Setup
  - Deployment Architecture & Failure Modes 
  - Security Models, Web Services & Applications 
- On boarding
  - Profiling & Application Protection 
  - Vulnerability Scanning & Mitigation 
- BAU Maintenance
  - Logging, Reporting, Housekeeping & Tuning 

## Who
Anyone deploying WAF, managing WAF or working within envirometns where WAF has been deployed already.
