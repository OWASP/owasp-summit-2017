Gábor Pék is the CTO of [Avatao](https://avatao.com), an online virtual platform that teaches people to build secure software. Gábor earned his Ph.D. degree in 2015 from the [CrySyS Lab](https://www.crysys.hu), Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary. He participated in several industrial projects (e.g., penetration testing, securing virtualization, cloud computing security) also. One of the hardware-level vulnerabilities he found (XSA-59/CVE-2013-3495) affected several Intel chipsets that enabled attacks against hypervisors such as Xen or KVM. He was one of the key members of the Duqu, Flame, Miniduke and Teamspy targeted attack investigation teams.

He founded and coordinates [CrySyS Student Core](https://core.crysys.hu) since April 2013, which is an invite-only group for exceptionally talented students who are interested in system security. This group gave birth to the [!SpamAndHex CTF](https://ctftime.org/team/5347) team, which became one of the top CTF teams in the world in 2 years. As a member of !SpamAndHex he is a three-times DEFCON CTF finalist that is widely regarded as the hacker world championship.
