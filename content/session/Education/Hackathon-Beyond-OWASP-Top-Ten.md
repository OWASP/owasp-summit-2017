## Why

In this hackathon, Participants can experience many security challenges ranging from web security to DevSecOps. The session is run on the [avatao](https://avatao.com) platform, an online tool that offers a wide variety of hands-on ITsec challenges. We demonstrate how deep the rabbit hole goes in terms of architecture, programming languages, or design. Avatao contains more than 400 challenges to achieve this. The session is useful for anyone who would like to get hands-on experience with cutting edge technologies (e.g., Unicorn Engine, Kaitai Struct) that shape our security today, or for anyone interested in solving more traditional challenges in web security or Java.

The primary goal is to have fun and gather feedback from the participants on the platform and ideas for new challenges for AppSec professionals.


## What

Planned topics for the hackathon: 
- Web security, 
- API security,
- Testing (BDD),
- Security misconfigurations,
- Docker security,
- Secure coding in C, 
- Secure coding in Java, 
- Security tools tutorials (Wireshark, Unicorn Engine),
- Crypto and protocol security,
- Hacker stuff (pwn, RE) on demand



## Outcomes

- Having fun 
- Learn new vulnerabilities and past epic failures ([Yahoo Mail stored XSS](https://klikki.fi/adv/yahoo2.html))
- Hands-on experience with cutting edge ITSec technologies (e.g., Kaitai Struct, Unicorn Engine)
- Collect new ideas for security challenges (secure coding in X, GDPR)

## General Rules to Participate

The hackathon will be organised on the [avatao](https://avatao.com) platform, which is a commercial product to teach people how to build secure products. In accordance with the general rules of the OWASP Summit 2017, a dedicated learning path will be set up for all the on-site and remote conference participants *free of charge*. The organisers of the Hackathon will help the participants on-site, but the Hackathon will continue to be available after the conference. 

## Outcome

We are more than happy to announce that our [challenge-engine](https://github.com/avatao/challenge-engine) is now open source under the very permissive *Apache 2 License*. Huge thank goes to [Dinis Cruz](https://twitter.com/DinisCruz) for pushing us to do that. This is the very first public version that anyone can use to build and run avatao challenges locally. We are going to update the descriptions and scripts continuously so that anyone can easily share challenges with all the folks on [avatao](https://avatao.com).
