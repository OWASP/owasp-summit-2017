## Why

A key problem of Agile practices in large organisations is 'how to measure them?'

If you have 10 squads/teams across multiple buildings/countries, how do you measure their 'level of agility'?

This Working Session will explore the use of Security Risks as a way to measure and visualise those practices. The core idea
is that the less Agile a team is, the more risks it will have and the harder it will be to make code changes/deployments.

## What

 - Defining the Risk metrics to look for (code deployments, patching issues, 'time to fix vulns' ratios, re-occurrence of bugs/vulnerabilities, missed deadlines, etc...)
 - Creating dashboards to visualise the data collected
 - What other metrics can be used to measure Agile Practices (outside risk)
 - How is this currently being tracked?

## Outcomes

- Agreed list of risk metrics
- Dashboards that visualise the data collected

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security professionals
- CISOs
- Agile practitioners
