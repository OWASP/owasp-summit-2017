SAMM core model update sessions. Review and improve the 12 SAMM practices towards SAMM v2.0 draft (based on the notes of last year's summit and the SAMM calls).

Since the SAMM core model was built 8-9 years ago, much has changed. This workshop will allow an initial discussion, and limited review, of ideas and directions to take the core model. We will look at the model vs implementation/prescriptive guidance.
