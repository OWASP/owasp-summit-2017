Align SAMM with other OWASP projects. Include OWASP projects as resources for the SAMM practices in SAMM v2.0 (started online [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SAMM-Resources))

## Why

SAMM provides a program level view of activities for securing software. We need to include more OWASP (and other) projects in this view to help promote both the projects and provide concrete solutions for practitioners. This session will review and recommend projects that could help complete activities identified within SAMM.

## What

- Review existing project alignment
- Provide recommendations for addition

## Outcomes
