## Why

AppSec and InfoSec talent are difficult to find these days,
for several reasons. It is a challenge for an industry corporation to accept
professionals who are unhappy with their current employment, would like to work
in a narrow fields such as security but only have experience in
other areas of IT or development. There are also many people, just starting out in the
industry and without experience or certifications (usually a degree in CS),
that cannot easily prove to a potential employer what they can achieve.  

All the while, there is a lack of, and high demand for,
professionals who can work with and grow in AppSec community. 

This session will also be a great place to hold thoughtful
conversations about different kinds of security careers, top skills in high
demand, and the newest opportunities within the field.

### Synopsis and Takeaways

We discussed the gap between companies’ needs to recruit talented AppSec people, and attracting the best AppSec people to come work at their company.
The Joel Test is a quick indicator of Development culture: an irresponsible, sloppy test to rate the quality of a software team. 
We have adapted the Joel Test to quickly indicate a company’s AppSec culture.
The test’s purpose is to help companies attract  the right talent and help talent to find the right company  

First draft of the AppSec Joel Test (in no specific order): 
- Does the company fund ongoing education for AppSec hires?
- Do developers undergo periodic AppSec training?
- Do AppSec people have quiet working environment?
- Are there both offense and defense teams, and do they work together?
- Can the AppSec team delay release (or fix) a new version or product?
- Is the AppSec team involved throughout the development lifecycle process?
- Can I access developers directly?
- Are security bugs treated like functional bugs?
- Is there some form of SDL / Maturity model / or other process in place?
- Can AppSec people choose their own tools (paid for by the company)?
- Is there a dedicated Incident Response team?
- Does the company contribute to Open Source and community efforts (or support personal contributions)?
