### Outcomes

A Draft List of Agile Security Practices

### Synopsis and Takeaways

The following categories highlight some of the key activities of an agile security team:

**Education**

- Define and deliver security training programmes

**Communication** 

- Security team to be visible, present at standups, available
- Connect dev to production
- Empower security champions

**Standardisation and Compliance**

- Own strong guidelines, e.g. data classification, regulatory, compliance
- Two tier security standards? mandatory, depend on risk/sensitivity etc.
- Library of standard stories

**Support**

- Technical support
- Help create security user stories, personas, anti-personas, patterns
- Culture of "security is not to say no, but to help"
- Testing
- Automation is needed for CI/CD e.g. tool to track 3rd party licenses
- "Development enablement tribe"

**Governance/Control**

- Project initiation touch point to define "gates"
- Prioritisation of involvement based on risk assessment, lifecycle stage
- Define "done"
- 3rd party maturity assessment 
- Internal compliance checks
- Centralised tracking in primary colours
- Security team KPIs
- Security organisation must be separate from development
- Monetary value on risks helps prioritisation
- Risk acceptance/escalation process

**Engineering**

- Bring in shared security solutions such as WAF- engineering effort

**Practices**

- Perhaps agile not applicable, more lean/kanban
- View security as functions, not people - resourcing can change but functions don't
- Don't be a blocker to agile, e.g. in operational approvals
- "Security team as a service"
- Struggle to manage BAU and hence forecasting: separate functions
- Need visibility of project portfolio
- Separation of duty can be a constraint
