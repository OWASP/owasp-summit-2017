This Working Session will discuss Student Chapter needs and their status. Student chapters need support from local chapters and OWASP members. We need to talk about a Student Chapter Leader Handbook.

## Why

The Student Chapter community is growing and we need to define a direction and establish a working group. We need to write a clear interaction between local chapters and student chapters. How can be sponsored a student chapter? can use OWASP on the MOVE funds?
There is not a handbook for student chapters, we need to create it during the summit.
