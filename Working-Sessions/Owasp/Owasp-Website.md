## Why

As the Summit will have the highest concentration of OWASP Leaders and Contributors with time to work on OWASP activities, this Working Session will be dedicated to the OWASP website, preferably in a Villa, with 6 to 8 participants. 

This kind of activity/transformation should be done and driven by OWASP Leaders and Contributors working together (vs buying a tool or hiring external services).

_From a sponsorship/cost point of view this would cost between 10 and 15k (depending on flights costs), which I think would be a great investment for OWASP._
