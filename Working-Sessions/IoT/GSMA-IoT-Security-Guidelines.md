> The goal of the Internet of Things Security Guidelines document set is to provide the implementer of an IoT technology or service with a set of design guidelines for building a secure product. To accomplish this task, this document will serve as an overarching model for interpreting what aspects of a technology or service are relevant to implementer. Once these aspects, or components, are identified, the implementer can evaluate the risks associated with each component, and determine how to manage them
