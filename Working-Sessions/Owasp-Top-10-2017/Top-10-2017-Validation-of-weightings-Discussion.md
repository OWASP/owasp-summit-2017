## Why


## What

Let's validate the approach set out in Session 2 given 2013, 2017 data and consider potential for 2020 data. Based upon this validation, we will need to potentially reorder, add or delete findings based around the defined weightings. 
This will help us create the weightings that will produce the 2017, 2020, and 2023 OWASP Top 10's especially as AI and ML will start to make an impact.  
 
## Outcomes 

### Synopsis and Takeaways

 * We are keeping 8 (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A8, A9) - consensus view
 * Data call open immediately to August 25 2017
 * Data format is to be the same for the 2017 data call for any additional data to ensure 
 * Get enough data for repeatable data calls in later years
 * In conjunction, survey community to develop the two forward looking items, also August 25
 * Compile a survey by June 30 (Brian Glas / Andrew van der Stock + anyone),
 * Deadline for delivery, November 25, 2017
