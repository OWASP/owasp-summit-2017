Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming mainstream techniques, and they provide a great opportunity for defenders.

## Why

We are on the cusp of a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence revolution. ML and AI techniques have recently re-emerged as powerful tools in various business sectors such as Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection, and Behavioral Analysis. Several companies and services are exploring these technologies and use them to solve specific security challenges successfully. 

Despite the success of ML and AI, there are security risks associated with them, especially during the learning phase which can be vulnerable to threats originated by potential adversaries, with consequent impact on prediction results. 

This Working Session will share common practices; what works today, and what is worth focusing on in the future.


## What

 - What are the available machine learning platforms?
 - Are there any security vulnerabilities associated with these platforms?
 - How to securely feed data to ML and AI tools
 - How to make learning algorithms aware of malicious data?
 - Can AI be used to reduce false positive findings in security scanners?
 - How can we spread the message among developers and security communities? 
 
## Outcomes

- Guidelines for secure usage of machine learning techniques.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Security professionals
 - ML and AI researchers
 - Devops
 - SOC teams
