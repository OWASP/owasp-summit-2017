## Why

Capturing logs and visualising them in a SOC (Security Operation Center) is a key activity in the asymmetric arms race against malicious actors (and bugs).

In addition to providing high value actionable information, a good SOC will allow provide a wealth of valuable metrics and visualisations for the business (from user activities/behaviour to to system performance)

## What

 - What are the the key technical and operational components of SOCs
 - Map examples of SOC implementations (people, process and technologies)
 - Best practices in capturing logs and feeding them intro central locations
 - How to visualise the data collected in actionable/meaningful graphs
 - Best practices in using tools like ELK or Splunk
 - Securing SOCs data and infrastucture
 - Business case for a larger SOC which is sponsored by other business unit (i.e. not just Security)
 - How to use Machine Learning and AI to improve data capture and analysis
 - How to use Business Intelligence techniques and Big Data tools to improve analysis and visualisations
 - Using AppSensor to feed data into SOC and to respond to analysis results
 - Explore specific security incidents:
    - Malware infection
    - Web Injection attack
    - Account Brute Force attacks
    - Login/activities from non-common locations
    - Business logic exploitation
    - Data extraction
 - How does SOC help with GDPR requirements
