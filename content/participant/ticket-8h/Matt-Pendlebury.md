I've worked in software development since '97 in everything from flight sims to robotic automation to hardware security modules, until moving full time into a cyber defence consultancy role in '14.  Getting security into application development is pivotal to our future security and safety.  To do this we need to raise the bar with development teams and make best use of the upcoming philosophies such as devsecops to deliver software practically.  My key focuses for this summit are to bring in my experience of pragmatically engaging with many software teams and the ways we have overcome the challenges they have faced keeping security pocesses light enough to be acceptable to the business.
