Ex developer and technical lead
Security consultant, helping companies with secure development, threat modeling, architecture reviews.

Innovative software and secure development practices are not a contradiction.

My main interests at the Summit: threat modelling, agile appsec. If time allows, also devsecops and opensamm.
