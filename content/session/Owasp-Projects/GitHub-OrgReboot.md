> The [OWASP GitHub organization](https://github.com/owasp) hosts some
> of the foundation's greatest projects. Unfortunately, there is a lot of
> rubble obstructing access to them. GitHub has become a kind of
> de-facto standard for OSS projects, and using this platform and
> associated ecosystem of SaaS to its full potential could make a big
> difference when it comes to gaining new contributors.

This Working Session will explore how OWASP can gain maximum benefit from its use of GitHub. 

## What

- What makes GitHub so special among its peers?
- How are other successful OSS organizations using GitHub?
- How can OWASP use GitHub more to its benefit?
- How high should the quality bar for OWASP org repositories be in the
  future?
- What are best practices and user expectations for OSS these days?
- How can we prevent new erosion after a "tabula rasa" clean-up or
  "reboot"?

## Outcomes

The following are the potential outcomes of the Working Session:

- GitHub repository owner guidelines
- GitHub org admin guidelines
- Addendum to the Project Leader Handbook specific for Code and Tool
  projects
- Extended/New quality checklist for Code and Tool projects
- Templates (e.g. `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` etc.) for a
  repo under OWASP org (see <https://github.com/OWASP/github-template>)
- Instructions for 3rd party QA/CI tool setup (e.g. Travis-CI,
  Code Climate etc.)

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Project leaders of OWASP Code or Tool projects
- Contributors to OWASP Code or Tool projects
