## Outcomes

### Synopsis/Takeaways

The session discussed the uses and implementations of internal Bug Bounties, which require selecting the correct applications and team (non-crunch team) to give an adequate return on resources invested. 

Organisational examples include
 - Starting with small controlled experiments with set timeframe
 - Insuring the correct participants are identified
 - Creation of roadmap for bug bounty program
 - Community-driven effort rather than HQ engineer-led
 - Set ranges for all monetised, gift, and concessions
 - Work with payroll to create plan for distribution of payments
 - Voluntary security training to identify key testers internally
 - Test accounts created with admins in place to provide support 
 - Inclusion/Exclusions of certain items (low priority) 
 - Encourage the focus on selected (high-risk) areas that give the best outcomes
 - Expectation setting (rules)
 - Use a recognition-based scoreboard that showcases the best internal talent for later projects
 - Tracking system: format standard for reporting, Unit tests, expectations of formal documentation, technologies used to create the bug, and a platform to send the report (GitHub/Jira, etc.)
 - Testing layer defences ethically from an internal, pre-approved point of view

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros

- Education for employees 
- Reduce risk for the organisation
- Security outreach
- Reduction of security bias
- Identify patterns in organisations for defects 
- When compared to external bug bounties which are black box, an internal bounty is a white/grey box which can increase efficiency and allow lessons learned to be shared across similar teams

#### Cons

- No guarantee of any favourable outcome
- Resources taken from other key areas 
- Conflict of interest
- Scalability can be a complex issue
