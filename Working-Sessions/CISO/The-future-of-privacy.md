Is there a future for privacy?

## Why

The target of this session is to illuminate the security of personal data from a strategic point of view:
risks, controls and measures, and future trends.
At the end of this session there should be a set of expert statements concerning current and future
challenges for improving the security of personal data.
We can use the statements to launch a public OWASP campaign on privacy.
A session concerning privacy was held during the OWASP Summit 2011 (see (1)) - the results of
that workshop may serve as a basis for the 2017 session.

It is possible to argue that privacy is not a priority in the work of OWASP, but I disagree.
- Privacy is a very important topic for everyone. As it relates to information security, it should be a priority for OWASP.
- Improving privacy in the future will primarily be a software challenge, especially for web applications and IoT. That is OWASP.
- OWASP is well known by experts, but not by the public. I think OWASP should have more weight in public discussion, and a privacy campaign is a good way to raise OWASP's public profile.

## What

- Personal data risk assessment: Definition and categorization of assets, criticality, vulnerabilities, threat vectors, risks.
  What work is already done, what remains to be worked out?
- Privacy-"triage": what kinds of data are already "lost", what can still be saved?
- Which technical solutions will we need in the future - not what is technically possible but what is needed
  from the viewpoint of individuals?
- What are the upcoming challenges of web application security for improving privacy/protection of personal data?
- Who are the stakeholders of these technical developments?
- Which driving forces can be used to kick-off development processes?

## Outcomes

- OWASP Privacy statements
- Concept of a campaign and compliance of OWASP community and foundation, road map

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Everyone who cares about privacy.
