It seems AppSec is a growing area for a lot of CISOs - you have secured the outside, you know where the traffic is going. You have a handle on data use and storage. But what are your apps doing?

## What

- What to beware of
- How to build teams and policies
- What frameworks to look out for 
- Technologies 
- Hints and tips
