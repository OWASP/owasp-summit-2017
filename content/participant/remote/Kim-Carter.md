## Kim Carter

NodeGoat is the next gen WebGoat, written in NodeJS, It comes with a tutorial covering the OWASP Top 10 + other vulnerabilities. NodeGoat also has a Security Regression Testing Proof of Concept (PoC) using the Zap API which is getting a lot of use in [training teams](https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/) around the importance of moving security from the most expensive place (go-live) to the cheapest (within the Development Teams Sprints). Based on [this PoC](https://github.com/binarymist/NodeGoat/wiki/Security-Regression-Testing-with-Zap-API), I've sold and implemented Security Regression Testing with Zap API within a large international companies development team and seen amazing results. I would like to move this forward, increase the coverage, add defect features, get all components and their docker images working in a nightly build to further demonstrate the huge advantages of moving security left and also demonstrate how useful Zap can be in the build process.

I would like to propose a NodeGoat workshop. The action plan is [here](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/NodeGoat.html).

The skills required for the following Working-Sessions appear to match my skill-set, and I would love to play a part in helping with them:

1. [OWASP NodeGoat](https://github.com/owasp/nodegoat)
2. [AWS Lamba Security](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Tools/AWS-Lambda-Security.html)
3. [NextGen Security Scanners](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Tools/NextGen-SecurityScanners.html)
4. [ZAP](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Project-Summit/ZAP.html)
5. [Threat Model](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Threat-Model/)
6. [Mobile Security](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/)


I would need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as I've been working for the love of security in our industry mostly on my book series "Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers" without income for many months - please let me know soon if this will be possible, as I will need to announce and prepare the workshop, and refrain from submitting further presentations and Working-Sessions around these dates.
