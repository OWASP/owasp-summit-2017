When creating horizontal security teams across multiple teams or squads, there are two models that have gained some traction: Security Guilds and Security Champions.

## Why

This working session will discuss common terminology and workflows, as it is important that industry agrees on and recognises the distinctions between Security Guilds and Security Champions.  

## What

 - What are the best definitions of Security Guilds and Security Champions?
 - How different are they?
 - Should Security Champions be part of a Security Guild?
 - Should they be merged?
 - Should we agree on one concept and push it has an industry?
 
## Outcomes

The planned outcome of this Working Session is to come up with a clear and concise definition, description, and difference of the two security team models.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Security Champions
