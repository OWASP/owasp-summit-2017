<!-- put more details about participant here -->I am currently completing research at the Regulated Software Research Centre based in Dundalk Institute of Technology. The RSRC is part of Lero, the Irish software research centre, which brings together leading software research teams from Universities and Institutes of Technology in a coordinated centre of research excellence with a strong industry focus.
My research is based in the regulated medical device domain, focusing on Mobile Medical Apps (MMAs). The research is to develop a framework for secure data flows to assist MMAs developers adhere to regulatory and best practice data security requirements. With HIPAA and the GDPR requirements for security and privacy of personal information and sensitive personal health information, this topic is very relevant for the inclusive health app community.The secure data flow process is a framework where I aim to apply developed recognised security controls from health domain standards, for data transmission flow, to the risk-centric Threat Modeling Analysis Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA). Further ambition for the research would be the application of the security controls to known vulnerabilities and referencing to the corresponding testing methods that could apply.
